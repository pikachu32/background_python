# Weather App

This is a simple weather app that retrieves current weather information for a specified city and sets the retrieved weather icon as the desktop background wallpaper. It uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data.

## Usage

1. Replace the `API_KEY` and `CITY` variables in the `main.py` file with your own OpenWeatherMap API key and the city name for which you want to fetch weather information.

2. Run the `main.py` script.

3. The script will make an API request to OpenWeatherMap, retrieve the weather data, and set the background wallpaper based on the weather icon.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Requests library (install it using `pip install requests`)

## Configuration

You need to obtain an API key from OpenWeatherMap by signing up on their website. Replace `"YOUR_API_KEY"` in the `main.py` file with your actual API key.

## Features

- Fetches current weather data for a specified city.
- Sets the desktop wallpaper based on the weather icon.
